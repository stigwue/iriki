# Iriki

Iriki, an API framework.

Source code is at [stigwue/iriki](https://github.com/stigwue/iriki).

## Why Iriki

Most PHP frameworks come with views, routing and a way to describe models and persist them.

Iriki thinks of apps as independent UIs consuming an API and as such handles the API solely.

Iriki uses language agnostic (JSON) configuration to handle models and routing.

## Features

* Automatic URL routing to appropriate models.

* Request and response logging.

* User and user groups with authentication.

* Configuration key-value dictionary.

* Email delivery (using Mailgun).

* File uploads.
