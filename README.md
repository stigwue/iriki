# Iriki

Iriki, a framework for APIs.

Source code is at [stigwue/iriki](https://github.com/stigwue/iriki).

## Why Iriki

Most PHP frameworks come with views, routing and a way to describe models and persist them.

Iriki thinks of apps as an independent UI consuming an API. It prefers the fluidity of NoSQL for easier modeling, easy routing and reusable models.

As such, Iriki uses language agnostic (JSON) configuration to handle models and routing.

## Features

Iriki comes with user (grouping and authentication) management and email sending (using Mailgun) to get you started.
