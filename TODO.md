## To Do

* 100% test coverage.

* Better/standard error description.

* Add user and user_group authentication to existing everyone authentication.

* Specify HTTP request method per request, handle PUT and DELETE methods.

* Add new Mongo support.

* Build in inter-operability (app.json should hold an array of apps, callable via config/code), also configurations provided in more than json files.

* Rewrite in PHP7.

* Check model synonyms, do they work in model and route properties and parameters (for belongs to and co)?

* Add 'scarf', an app for automating common Iriki tasks.
