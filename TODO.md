# Iriki

Iriki, an API framework.

Source code is at [stigwue/iriki](https://github.com/stigwue/iriki).

## To Do

* 100% test coverage.

* 100% self-documentation using Doxygen parsable comments.

* Handle PUT and DELETE methods (?).

* Add user and user_group authentication, making authentication levels: anyone, everyone, one, group.

* Add 'scarf', an app for automating common Iriki tasks.

* Build in inter-operability with other Iriki apps (app.json should hold an array of apps, callable via config/code)?

* Rewrite in PHP7?

* Provide configurations in more than json files?

* Use _hasmany_ relationship to recurse read?

* Better/standard error description?

* Add other NoSQL db support?
